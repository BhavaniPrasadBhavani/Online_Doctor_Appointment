### Key Highlights
- **Secure Authentication** for patients, doctors, and admins.
- **Role-Based Access** to keep each user’s data and functionalities well-defined.
- **Responsive Front End** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Spring Boot** for a robust, production-ready Java backend.
- **MySQL** for reliable data storage.

**controller/** – Contains Java classes handling HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
- **model/** – Houses the entity classes (e.g., `Appointment.java`) which map to database tables.
- **repository/** – Holds interfaces like `AppointmentRepository.java` that extend Spring Data JPA for database operations.
- **static/** – Front-end resources (CSS, JS, images).
- **templates/** – HTML files for the UI if you’re using Thymeleaf or similar templating engines.
- **application.properties** – Contains environment-specific configurations (like database connection details).

## Features
- **Patient Registration & Login**: Secure sign-up and login flow.
- **Appointment Booking**: Users can schedule appointments with a preferred doctor, choose date/time slots, and receive confirmations.

## Tech Stack
- **Front End**:  
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Optional libraries (e.g., Bootstrap for styling, jQuery for simpler JS)

- **Back End**:  
  - **Spring Boot (Java)** for RESTful APIs
  - **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions
  - **Maven** for dependency management

- **Database**:  
  - **MySQL** (with JDBC driver)

- **Others**:  
  - **Thymeleaf** (if you’re rendering HTML templates server-side)  
  - **Git/GitHub** for version control
